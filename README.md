# Student-Record-Management-System

The mini-project “Student Record System Project in C” is a console application using the C programming language. This project compiled in Code Blocks with the GCC compiler. In this console application, you can do basic Student Record tasks like adding the student info, view the added student, search the students, ..etc.

Also to increase the readability, I have broken the application in different functions. Each function of the project extensively use in the file handing function, so it is also a great project to understand file handling in C.

Note: Don’t copy and paste the code for your project. Use the code to learn and do the project yourself.
